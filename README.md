# BookMeLocal
A website that allows users to book appointments with local businesses. The business, like a car mechanic, can tie their scheduler into this app, then users can select time slots. The user will then have a master calendar that has all of their appointments listed on it.


# BrainStorm Ideas
- Login Page
- Companies create an account and link their scheduler to this app. They then can login to see what appointments have been created. Future modifications would be to add the ability to push the appointments created in BookMeLocal to their local scheduler.
- User create an account.
      - They then search for "Car Mechanic" and get the results back
      - They click on the company they want to use (future additions would be to add google reviews to the page)
      - The companies calendar appears and they select a date and time to book an appointment.
      - When you click on a time slot, a modal appears asking what services they provide, you select which one you want, confirm the
          information, and then the appointment is added to your master calendar and the companies.
- Future addition to add a finance section that tracks how much you spent, companies can add invoices for your records, potentially tax
      forms, etc.
